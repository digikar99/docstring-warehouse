### FUNCTION

(HANDLER-CASE form { (type ([var]) body) }* )

Execute FORM in a context with handlers established for the condition types. A
peculiar property allows type to be :NO-ERROR. If such a clause occurs, and
form returns normally, all its values are passed to this clause as if by
MULTIPLE-VALUE-CALL. The :NO-ERROR clause accepts more than one var
specification.
