FIND-PACKAGE
---

### FUNCTION

If PACKAGE-DESIGNATOR is a package, it is returned. Otherwise PACKAGE-DESIGNATOR
must be a string designator, in which case the package it names is located and returned.

As an SBCL extension, the current package may affect the way a package name is
resolved: if the current package has local nicknames specified, package names
matching those are resolved to the packages associated with them instead.

Example:

  (defpackage :a)
  (defpackage :example (:use :cl) (:local-nicknames (:x :a)))
  (let ((*package* (find-package :example)))
    (find-package :x)) => #<PACKAGE A>

REMOVE-PACKAGE-LOCAL-NICKNAME, and the DEFPACKAGE option :LOCAL-NICKNAMES.
