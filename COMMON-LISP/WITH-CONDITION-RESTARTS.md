WITH-CONDITION-RESTARTS
---

### FUNCTION

Evaluates the BODY in a dynamic environment where the restarts in the list
   RESTARTS-FORM are associated with the condition returned by CONDITION-FORM.
   This allows FIND-RESTART, etc., to recognize restarts that are not related
   to the error currently being debugged. See also RESTART-CASE.
