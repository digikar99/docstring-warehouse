*DEBUGGER-HOOK*
---

### VARIABLE

This is either NIL or a function of two arguments, a condition and the value
   of *DEBUGGER-HOOK*. This function can either handle the condition or return
   which causes the standard debugger to execute. The system passes the value
   of this variable to the function because it binds *DEBUGGER-HOOK* to NIL
   around the invocation.
