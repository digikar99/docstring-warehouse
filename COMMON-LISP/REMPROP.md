REMPROP
---

### FUNCTION

Look on property list of SYMBOL for property with specified
  INDICATOR. If found, splice this indicator and its value out of
  the plist, and return the tail of the original list starting with
  INDICATOR. If not found, return () with no side effects.

  NOTE: The ANSI specification requires REMPROP to return true (not false)
  or false (the symbol NIL). Portable code should not rely on any other value.
