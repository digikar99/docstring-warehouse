### FUNCTION

Starts the editor (on a file or a function if named).  Functions
from the list *ED-FUNCTIONS* are called in order with X as an argument
until one of them returns non-NIL; these functions are responsible for
signalling a FILE-ERROR to indicate failure to perform an operation on
the file system.
