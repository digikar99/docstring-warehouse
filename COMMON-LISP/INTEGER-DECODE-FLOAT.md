INTEGER-DECODE-FLOAT
---

### FUNCTION

Return three values:
   1) an integer representation of the significand.
   2) the exponent for the power of 2 that the significand must be multiplied
      by to get the actual value. This differs from the DECODE-FLOAT exponent
      by FLOAT-DIGITS, since the significand has been scaled to have all its
      digits before the radix point.
   3) -1 or 1 (i.e. the sign of the argument.)
