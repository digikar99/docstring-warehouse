RESTART-BIND

### FUNCTION

(RESTART-BIND ({(case-name function {keyword value}*)}*) forms)
   Executes forms in a dynamic context where the given bindings are in
   effect. Users probably want to use RESTART-CASE. A case-name of NIL
   indicates an anonymous restart. When bindings contain the same
   restart name, FIND-RESTART will find the first such binding.
